Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Spotify Streaming Data

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis project using a Spotify tracks dataset. All work was completed by following an instructional walkthrough video for Code:You DA/AUG25.

The purpose of this project is to practice basic EDA techniques, including inspecting datasets, summarizing variables, identifying missing or unexpected values, and visualizing relationships between features using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
